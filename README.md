# Portfolio Website in Vue3 #

This is the code of my portfolio.

The project is a **Single Page Application** made in Vue3. The frontend runs on Firebase Hosting. Mailing functionality is provided by a backend service which runs on NodeJS/Express.

The project is fully animated. On the homepage, the animation is made with **three.js**. The mobile menu is animated with **Vanilla JS**. All other animations are **native Vue3 Transitions**.
